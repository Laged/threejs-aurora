# Three.js Aurora Borealis Experiment

This project is a real-time, procedural aurora borealis effect built from scratch using three.js and GLSL shaders, all contained within a single `index.html` file.

## About This Project

This was an experiment in "vibe coding" to see if the techniques from an amazing Unity-based tutorial could be replicated in three.js. The entire effect was built iteratively, starting with a simple deformed plane and progressively adding more complex shader logic.

The goal was to follow the concepts—not copy the code—from the original blog post.

### Original Inspiration

All credit for the techniques and inspiration goes to **Roy Theunissen**. This project is simply a three.js interpretation of his brilliant breakdown.

## Features

• **100% Procedural**: No video, no textures (after our failed attempts!). The entire effect is generated by GLSL noise functions.
• **Real-time Controls**: Includes sliders to finetune the effect's parameters (wave amplitude, speed, fresnel, and ray sharpness).
• **Single File**: All HTML, CSS (via Tailwind), and JavaScript/three.js code is in `aurora.html`.
• **Advanced Shader Techniques**:
  • Vertex shader displacement for large-scale waves.
  • Fractal Brownian Motion (FBM) for complex ray patterns.
  • Procedural streak masks to create gaps and variation.
  • Correct fresnel/rim-lighting calculated from displaced normals.
  • Procedural fall-off curves to simulate a "sharp start, long tail" light effect.
